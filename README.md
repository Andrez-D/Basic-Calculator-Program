# Basic-Calculator-Program
It is a simple calculator that calculates.


How it works:
The program accepts two numbers (floats to allow decimals).

It asks for an operation symbol.

Depending on the operation, it computes the result and prints it in the format "num1 operation num2 = result".

It handles division by zero with an error message.

If the input operation is invalid, it informs the user.
